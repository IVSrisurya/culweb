Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was the eldest son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj - the good Maratha warrior king. Shivaji Maharaj belonged to the Bhonsle clan and was born on 19th February 1627. Shivaji Maharaj built the Hindawi Swaraj - the Self-rule of Indians as against that of the Mughals who identified themselves as descendants from Tamerlane of Mongolia and also of Turcik - Central Asian (Chagtai) bloodline. <span id = "dots1">....</span> <span id="more1"> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj died on 3rd April 1680 but in his lifetime, he laid the inspiration for the genesis of the Maratha empire - a solid bulwark against invaders. His son Sambhaji Maharaj had an enormous task cut out before him - to defend the Maratha empire against the might of the Mughals in Delhi who were later subdued and decimated by the Maratha armies) and to hold on the vision and policies of Shivaji Maharaj. </span>

		RISE OF MARATHA EMPIRE:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 Sambhaji Maharaj had witnessed the lengths the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb would attend annihilate any challenge to the Mughal might. Aurangzeb had succeeded his father Shah Jahan by treachery and fratricide of his three brothers. After killing his brothers in cold blood and imprisoning the daddy - the builder of the Taj Mahal - he's said to possess killed brother Dara Shikoh's two sons and made his widows to marry him. He began forcing conversions of the local Indians to Islam and imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims.

After Shivaji Maharaj's death, Sambhaji had several challenges on hand: the Mughals within the north, and other neighbouring powers like the Siddis, Mysore and therefore the Portuguese in Goa.</span>

		ATTACK FROM MUGHALS:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 In 1681, Aurangzeb's fourth son Akbar reached Deccan (variation for Dakshin or the South) and tried to consolidate forces against his father's rule out Delhi. 
To quell this rebellion and to undertake to end off the Maratha empire, Aurangzeb left Delhi with 4-5 lakh soldiers and headed to Khirki - what's today's Aurangabad in Maharashtra.
In 1682, Aurangzeb tried attacking the Maratha Empire from all directions. He intended to use the Mughal numerical superiority to his advantage. Sambhaji had prepared well for the invasions and therefore the Maratha forces promptly engaged the numerically strong Mughal army in several small battles using guerilla warfare tactics. </p><p>

<span id = "dots3">....</span> <span id="more3">
Aurangzeb's son Akbar had approached Sambhaji Raje for help. Shambhu Raje had promised him assistance to fight Aurangzeb. But Akbar soon fled to Persia. 
Meanwhile, Sambhaji Maharaj continued to fight alongside his generals altogether battles and wars at hand. Aurangzeb had seen Sambahji Raje in 1966 also when the feisty Shambhu Raje had accompanied his brave father to the Mughal court in Agra. </span>

		DECIEVEMENT:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 Aurangzeb had invited the 2 for his birthday celebrations at the Darbar but imprisoned them by deceit. for nearly three months, the father-son duo was held under confinement . The maturity of the young lad was seen within the way he handled the time he was near Mathura secretly on his way back to Maharashtra) disguised as a Brahmin priest's child and was accosted by Mughal soldiers who suspected that he was Sambhaji the young Maratha prince.
"Eat within the same plate, if you two are really father and son from a priestly family," the soldiers ordered. The accompanying Brahmin priest wondered how the young lad will pull it off. Will his princely stature become a prestige issue and blow the lid over their true identities? No such thing happened.
<span id = "dots4">....</span> <span id="more4">
The boy acted as if the accompanying priest was indeed his father and broke bread with him without betraying the reality . Aurangzeb regretted this failure on his own part till his dying day.
After Shivaji Maharaj's death, Sambhaji Raje succeeded him, details of which i'm not stepping into here. He carried on the great governance of his father. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was loved and revered by his subjects.

		GLORY:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 British origin historian Dennis Kincaid writes, "He (Sambhaji) was ordered by the Emperor to embrace Islam. He refused and was made to run the gauntlet of the entire Imperial army. Tattered and bleeding he was brought before the Emperor and repeated his refusal. His tongue was torn and again the question was put. He involved writing material and wrote 'No, never!' So then he was put to death by torture". He was beheaded and his head was mounted on a pike that was then showed the general public so on demoralise them.
"His sacrifice has earned Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj the spot of reverence in the hearts of all.
<span id = "dots5">....</span> <span id="more5">
Aurangzeb managed to capture him by deceit on 1 February 1689. Sambhaji Maharaj was tortured for days and killed within the most heinous fashion and died on 11 March 1689. He showed exemplary courage in facing death only to guard three of the items he held most dear in life... Dev, Desh, and Dharma (God, Country, and Religion). that's the rationale why he's revered in Maharashtra. People realise and appreciate the very fact that he didn't fall prey to Aurangzeb's tactics, and chose to embrace death instead of betray the cause he stood for," an author of several books chronicling the Maratha empire's era said. Not wishing to be named here, this author is an authority on Maratha history and is ready to publish his latest book on the lifetime of Sambhaji Maharaj soon.<p>Meanwhile, another celebrated author of Maratha history - Aneesh Gokhale (his book "Battles of Maratha Empire" among several others he has penned) says, "Chhatrapati Sambhaji held off a grand Mughal army numbering 5,00,000 souls led by Aurangzeb himself for nearly a decade. The Mughals' aim of creating an example out of him by capturing Chhatrapati Sambhaji, and torturing him to death backfired because the Marathas were galvanised to fight even harder. In life, Chhatrapati Sambhaji led a decade long struggle against the Mughals, in death he inspired them to fight for 2 decades more.</p>
