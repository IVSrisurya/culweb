	<h1>
		Early Life:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 Gautama Maharishi had a grandson called Śaradvān. Śaradvān was born with arrows, making clear he was a born archer. As he matured, he became such an excellent archer and commenced doing penance to become an unbeatable one. This threatened the gods, especially Indra. He then sent a gorgeous Apsara, Janapadi, from heaven to distract the celibate saint. Śaradvān was distracted by the sight of such a gorgeous woman and lost some control, dropping his weapons and retreating into the forest to undergo more penance. His semen fell on some weeds by the wayside, dividing the weeds into two - from which a boy and a woman were born. The king of Hastinapura, Shantanu was out for hunting. A soldier of Shantanu saw the twins and brought them to the king. Shantanu became so compassionate towards them that he adopted them and named them Kripa and Kripi, "Kripa" meaning pity. As he adopted them out of pity. He decided to require them back with him to his palace.
When Śaradvān came to understand of those children he came to the palace, revealed their identity and performed the varied rituals which are performed for the youngsters of Brahmins. He also taught the youngsters archery, the Vedas, and other Shastras.</p>

<p>
The children grew up to become experts within the art of warfare. Kripa was now assigned the task of teaching the young princes all about warfare. On reaching adulthood, Kripa was the chief priest at the court of Hastinapura. His twin sister Kripi married Drona, the weapons master to the court - who, like her and her brother, had not been gestated during a womb, but outside the physical body . </p><p>
He fought in the great battle of Kurukshetra for the Kaurava side. He was one of the three survivors remaining from the Kaurava side. Afterwards, he was appointed to be the teacher and preceptor of Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna.</p></span>

		Role in Mahabharata:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 <p>
In Udyoga Parva of the Mahabharata, Bhishma declared Kripa as a mighty Maharathi, or a warrior capable of fighting 60,000 warriors simultaneously; circumspect in his mastery of all sorts of weapons and combat skills.
As noted in sloka given below, he's one among the seven Chiranjivin (the "immortals") who are to stay alive throughout the Kali Yuga.
अश्वत्थामा बलिर्व्यासो हनुमांश्च विभीषणः। कृपः परशुरामश्च सप्तैते चिरंजीविनः ।।</p>

		On the 12th day of war:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 <p>
The noble Kripa, son of Sharadwata, with many small arrows resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni race who was the embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that checked out Kripa, son of Sharadwata, with many small arrows, resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni race who was the embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that checked out Kripa and Vardhakshemi, those heroes conversant with every mode of warfare, thus engaged in encountering one another , became so absorbed in it that, they might not attend to anything . Kripa spent his later days doing penance within the forest.
As per Hindu belief, Kripacharya remains alive.
Some believe he roams the world and suffers for the sins he committed on the night of the 18th day of Kurukshetra war.</p>
