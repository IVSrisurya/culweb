		 <h4>
Story of the Ball in the Well</h4><p>
Once, the Pandavas and Kauravas were fidgeting with a picket ball outside. The ball accidentally falls under a close-by empty well. All of the princes tried to require it out, however, it absolutely was too deep. At that moment, Drona strolled past them. He watched them and chuckled. He then aforesaid, “Shame on you princes! you're the descendants of King Bharata, however, you can’t retrieve this ball. Watch, I will be able to take it out with a sequence of grass.”</p><p>
Saying that Drona threw a blade of grass at the ball and cut it. He then cut the blade of grass with another blade of grass and continued till a sequence was fashioned. victimization of the chain, he simply removed the ball. The princes were astonied by this not possible accomplishment. “We have not seen this talent anyplace. you're really nice. What will we have a tendency to do for you?” they lauded.</p><p>
“Tell Bhishma regarding my talent. He will certainly acknowledge WHO I'm,” Drona taught. consequently, the princes upon Bhishma regarding what had happened. Bhishma like a shot knew that this was none aside from Drona. He in person visited Drona, WHO told him about everything that had happened. Bhishma aforesaid, “Oh Brahmin, create the Kuru princes practiced within the use of arms. I would like you to be their teacher. I'm really grateful that you just are teaching the princes.” Drona promptly accepted Bhishma’s supply.</p>
<span id = "dots5">....</span> <span id="more5">
<h4>
His Favorite Student</h4><p>
Bhishma precocious Drona with a house and tons of wealth. Thereafter, the Pandavas and Kauravas began learning from Drona. They referred to as him “Dronacharya” (acharya suggests that teacher). One day, Dronacharya referred to as all the princes and aforesaid, “I have a motive in my heart. Promise Pine Tree State that when you become practiced with weapons, you may accomplish this motive on behalf of me.” Silence. Utter Silence. Not one among the princes aforesaid a word. on the other hand suddenly, the Arjuna stepped up and vowed that he would accomplish this motive, in spite of what it's. Dronacharya started shedding tears of happiness. From that day, Arjuna became Drona’s favorite. As you may see, Arjuna would continue pleasing Drona.</p><p>
 Dronacharya started teaching the princes the utilization of assorted weapons. Several alternative princes from across Bharatvarsha flocked to find out from Dronacharya. The Vrishnis, Andhakas, and even Karna, the son of Adhiratha Suta, started learning from Drona. From all of those princes, Arjuna was clearly the simplest at the utilization of weapons. Drona dear Arjuna, however he conjointly dear him son Ashwatthama. Hence, whenever Drona would send his pupils to fetch water, he would provide them a narrow-mouthed vessel. however, he gave his son Ashwatthama a wide-mouthed vessel. Ashwatthama was so ready to fill his vessel quicker and quickly come to his father. In these very few intervals, Drona would teach his son concerning celestial weapons. Once Arjuna learned of this, he started quickly filling his vessel victimization the Varunastra weapon to summon water. He would come at an identical time as Ashwatthama and receive identical lessons.</p><p>
Arjuna’s devotion to his guru and also the science of arms quickly created him Drona’s favorite. Once, whereas Arjuna was ingesting dinner, a robust breeze blew out the lamps. however, Arjuna unbroken ingestion within the darkness. At that moment, Arjuna accomplished that through habit, he might master athletics within the darkness similarly. Thus, Arjuna began active athletics in the hours of darkness. Once Drona detected the twang of the bow, he approached Arjuna and same: I offer you a promise that you simply shall become and stay the best archer within the world!</p><p>

Drona then started teaching Arjuna the way to fight on horseback, on AN elephant, on a chariot, and on the bottom. Arjuna was tutored the way to use a weapon system, javelin, lance, mace, and also the dart.</p><h4>
Ekalavya cuts off his right thumb</h4><p>One day, the Pandavas and Kauravas went on a looking excursion with Drona’s permission. A servant with a dog followed the princes. The dog got separated from its owner and wandered into the woods. Suddenly, the dog encountered a teenager and started loudly barking. The adolescent quickly sent seven arrows into the mouth of the dog, which stopped it from barking. The dog ran back to the looking party. once the Pandavas saw what had been done to the dog, they were stuffed with surprise and awe. WHO was this impeccable archer? however, might he try this while not killing the dog?</p><p>
The Pandavas started looking out the woods. In time, the Pandavas came upon the boy dextrously discharging arrows from his looking bow. once the Pandavas asked him WHO he was, he replied, “I am Ekalavya, son of King Hiranyadhanus of the Nishadhas. I'm a pupil of Guru Drona. i used to be rejected by Drona, however, I used to be determined to master athletics. thus I created a clay sculpture of Drona and practiced ahead of it. Soon, I down pat athletics.”</p><p>
The Pandavas conversed with Ekalavya then came back to Drona’s dwelling house. The Pandavas told him concerning Ekalavya. Drona regretted having rejected Ekalavya. however whereas the opposite Pandavas were with excitement discussing his feats, Arjuna was in deep thought… when the others left, Arjuna went up to Drona and expressed his thoughts: “Earlier, you had secure American state that I'd be your greatest pupil. Why then is Ekalavya superior to me?”</p><p>
Drona painfully mirrored for an instant. Realizing what had to be done, Drona, in the course of Arjuna, visited to meet Ekalavya. Drona said, “Ekalavya, if you're really my pupil, then you need to provide American state guru Dakshina (repaying one’s teacher when education).” Ekalavya responded, “Guruji, I'm grateful to own the chance to administer you one thing. enkindle something, and that I shall provide it.” “Well then, provide American state your right thumb,” Drona demanded. Drona knew that while not his right thumb, Ekalavya would ne'er be pretty much as good as before. Arjuna would be ready to surpass him in athletics skills. while not hesitant, Ekalavya brings to a halt his right thumb. Drona, WHO felt shamefaced, and Arjuna, whose jealousy was cured, departed. Ekalavya would continue active athletics, however, he would ne'er be pretty much as good as before…</p>
<h4>
Karna Asks for the Brahma Weapon</h4><p>
Seeing Arjuna receive the Brahmashira Astra, Karna approached Drona and requested, “I too wish to find out the information of the Brahmastra weapon. Please provides it to the American state.” However, Drona knew that Karna was associating with the wicked Duryodhana. He conjointly favored Arjuna. Thus, he said, “Only worthy Kshatriyas and Brahmins will receive the Brahmastra. I cannot provide it to you.” Karna was very demoralized and left to travel to Parshuram.</p><h4>
Drona's Revenge</h4><p>
After Drona completed the formal coaching of the Kuru princes, he demanded that they invade Panchala and produce him Drupada as their Gurudakshina. Arjuna succeeds in defeating Drupada and brings the captured king to Drona. Drona reminds Drupada concerning their days of a relationship and his false promise before doing away with 1/2 the Panchala kingdom.[9] Drona would build Ashwatthama the king of the annexed 1/2 the Panchala kingdom. This action would lead Drupada to perform a killing yagna so as to engender a son WHO would kill Drona. The sages Upayaja and Yaja helped him to engender such a son Dhrishtadyumna. The killing fireplace conjointly yielded a girl, Draupadi</p><br><p></p><br>
<h4>Kurukshetra War and Death</h4><p>
After the Pandavas’ exile, war was declared between the Pandavas and Kauravas. Drona joined the Kauravas because it was his duty to fight for the Kuru clan. Ashwatthama, being a friend of Duryodhana, also joined the Kauravas. In the Kurukshetra war, Drona annihilated many Pandava armies and kings/princes. On the tenth night, after the defeat of Bhishma, the Pandavas needed a knew commander-in-chief. Karna suggested that Drona should become the next commander-in-chief, saying that he is the oldest and most experienced. Drona was honored and asked Duryodhana to ask for anything he wanted. Duryodhana said that he wanted Drona to capture Yudhistira. Drona agreed and promised Duryodhana that he would capture Yudhistira.</p><p>
On the 11th day, Drona was unstoppable. He defeated Dhristadyumna, Abhimanyu, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva and even killed a few young princes from the family of Drupada. As Drona kept getting closer to Yudhistira, the Pandava forces started panicking. Arjuna heard this panic and approached Drona. Duryodhana ordered thousands of chariot fighters to attack Arjuna, but Arjuna killed them all. Arjuna didn’t let Drona get to Yudhistira. That night, Duryodhana ridiculed Drona so much for failing.</p><p>
On the twelfth day, Susharma made a vow that he would fight Arjuna and distract him so that Drona could capture Arjuna. When the war began on that day, Drona was in rage. He first engaged Satyaki, who, aided by Pandava forces, defeated Drona. Drona then regained his composure and started attacking Panchala forces, killing two more princes from the family of Drupada. Drona then single-handedly defeated Satyaki, Chekitana, Dhristadyumna, and Shikhandi. Then Bhima challenged Dronacharya. Bhima, aided by Dhristadyumna and Satyaki, was able to defeat Dronacharya. Drona then fought Arjuna, Dhristadyumna, Satyaki, and Abhimanyu.</p><p>
That night, Duryodhana was enraged at Dronacharya. He had now failed twice. Dronacharya started losing his patience as Duryodhana mocked him. “Oh Duryodhana. Yudhistira knows we are trying to capture him. It is now really difficult as he is well-guarded. But I will try my best. Tomorrow, I will form the Chakravyuha. Arjuna will be led away by Susharma and his army. Only Arjuna knows how to penetrate this formations. One of the Pandava heroes will surely get trapped and killed.”</p><p>
On the thirteenth day, Dronacharya formed the Chakravyuha. Arjuna was already far away from the battlefield. The warrior who entered the battlefield was Abhimanyu, followed closely by the 4 Pandavas. But Jayadratha cut off the Pandavas’ entrance to the Chakravyuha. He had a boon from Lord Shiva that one day in his life, he won’t be defeated by anybody. Today was that day, so the Pandavas couldn’t do anything. Abhimanyu proceeded into the Chakravyuha alone. Abhimanyu knew how to enter the Chkravyuha, but not how to exit it. Because of this, he got trapped in the middle with all the main Kuru warriors. Abhimanyu killed many kings on the Kuru side and caused a lot of havoc. But in the end, multiple warriors attacked him on all sides and he was killed by Durjaya, the son of Dushasana.</p><p>
That night, Arjuna made a vow that he would kill Jayadratha. On the fourteenth day, Drona formed the Shakata Vyuha to protect Jayadratha. Even though the vyuha was miles long and Jayadratha was at the far end, Arjuna was unstoppable. He killed countless princes and kings on the Kaurava side. Soon, he reached Dronacharya. Drona and Arjuna kept fighting and it didn’t look like anyone was defeating the other. Arjuna soon realized this and told Krishna to leave Drona and move forward. When Krishna did so, Drona started following Arjuna’s chariot. But Dhristaketu from Chedi stood in the way of Drona and Arjuna. With a roar, Dhristaketu challenged Drona.</p><p> They fiercely fought but in the end, Drona fired the Anjalikastra and killed Dhristaketu. But Dhristaketu had bought Arjuna time to get away from Drona. Dronacharya then attacked Dhristadyumna and killed many Panchala princes. After a fierce fight, Drona was about to kill Dhristadyumna when Satyaki intervened. Satyaki was able to keep Drona at bay. Meanwhile, Yudhistira worried that Arjuna might need help, so he sent Satyaki. When Satyaki reached Drona, he just evaded him because he knew he couldn’t defeat Drona. Yudhistira then sent Bhima to help Arjuna and Satyaki. Bhima destroyed Drona’s chariot eight times.</p><p> In the end, Drona and the Kuru warriors tried their best, but Arjuna killed Jayadratha before sunset. That night, the battle continued after sunset and in the night battle, Ghatotgacha was killed. On the fifteenth day, Drona destroyed more of the Panchala forces and killed King Sibi. Drona then engaged Satyaki, Bhima, and Dhristadyumna. He then encountered and killed his old friend, Drupada. After that, he killed King Virata of Matsya. Seeing his father dead, Dhristadyumna was enraged and charged at Drona. But Duryodhana, Karna, and Shakuni formed a protective circle around Drona. Soon, Arjuna and Bhima arrived there. A fearsome fight ensued between Arjuna and Drona. They both kept firing at each other and every arrow was countered.</p><p>Knowing he can’t win against Arjuna, Drona left him alone and starting destroying the Panchala army. As he remembered the way Duryodhana had insulted him over the past few days, he grew more and more raged and attacked with more ferocity. Soon, he started using celestial weapons on the soldiers, which was forbidden by the rules of war, but Drona didn’t care right now. Yudhistira became worried as he saw Drona destroying his armies. He went to Krishna for advice. “Oh king, Drona is going to continue to slaughter our armies. If he continues like this, there will be no army by this evening. The only way to kill him is to make him drop his weapons,” Krishna said.</p><p>“And the only way to make him drop his weapons is to kill Ashwastamma. If he thinks Ashwastamma is dead, he will lose hope and quit fighting. Dhristadyumna can then kill him,” Krishna continued. “But you can’t kill Ashwastamma. He is a Chiranjivi (immortal),” Arjuna said. “We don’t have to kill the guru’s son Ashwastamma. There is another Ashwastamma, the elephant. Bhima can kill that elephant and then we can cry out that Ashwastamma is dead,” Krishna said. Arjuna and Yudhistira were shocked and didn’t like deceiving their guru, but they knew they had no other option. Bhima immediately went and found that elephant. He killed the elephant and its rider, Indravarma, the ruler of Malva. Bhima then went around screaming that Ashwastamma was dead. Drona’s limbs seemed to dissolve, but then he remembered his son’s prowess and realize Bhima was lying.</p><p>Drona again started fighting vigorously and released the Brahmastra on Pandava forces. Seeing this, Bharadwaja, Vashishta, Gautama, Kashyapa and many other holy sage along with Agni appeared in the sky and told Drona that he was not obeying the rules of war. They also told him that his end was soon to come. Drona said that he had taken a vow to destroy the Pandava army and since so many rules had been broken already, there was no point.</p><p>
Bhima then came to Dronacharya and said, “Oh Brahmin, what are you doing. You should be offering austerities and doing penance. But instead you are here, massacring soldiers, and that too unfairly. You should be ashamed. Your son is dead, and you keep fighting.”
Drona was struck by these words. He started second-guessing his decision that Ashwastamma isn’t dead. Drona dropped in his chariot. He remembered the words of the sages and of Bhima. What if Ashwastamma was actually dead? He looked around and saw Dhristadyumna fighting nearby.</p><p> Maybe it was time for his death? To be sure of Ashwastamma’s death, there was only one person who wouldn’t lie: Yudhistira. Krishna saw Drona coming near Yudhistira and said, “Oh Yudhistira, look, Dronacharya is coming to ask you. Please save us from the wrath of Drona and just tell him Ashwastamma is dead. According to the scriptures, it’s okay to lie in certain situations.” Reluctantly, Yudhistira told Dronacharya, “Ashwastamma is dead.” Then he whispered, “Whether the elephant or man, I know not.” Drona was heartbroken. He dropped his weapons and sank into grief.
</p><p>
Dhristadyumna now attacked Dronacharya. Drona weakly picked up his bow and started firing back. He tried invoking celestial weapons, but they didn’t appear. Soon, his inexhaustible quiver of arrows ran out of arrows and Drona realized he is supposed to die now. He lay down his bow and repeatedly cried out Ashwastamma’s name. He then said, “Duryodhana, Karna, Kripacharya. Fight with prowess. I am now departing this Earth.” Saying so, Drona sat down in his chariot in a meditative posture and made his soul leave his mortal body. Not knowing Drona was already dead, Dhristadyumna ran up to him and beheaded him. Arjuna and Yudhistira were deeply saddened by the deceitful killing of Drona.
