Telugu soil has seen some brave freedom fighters who have given enough push within the Indian Independence Struggle. One such brave heart who was one among the first freedom fighters was the fierce Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy. within the early colonial rule, British rulers oppressed the Indian rulers in their expansion mode. They fleeced the local rulers and chieftains, to forcefully collect the taxes from people. <span id = "dots1">....</span> <span id="more1"> ... </span>

		BIRTH AND GROWTH:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 One such ruler was Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy of Rayalaseema Region. He was born around early 1800’s to the local chieftains’ (Zamindari) family within the present Kurnool district on the banks of Kundi River. Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy is one among the earliest freedom fighters in India. Reddy, who had 66 villages under his control and a military of 2000 men, couldn't contain the atrocities committed by the corrupt officials of EIC (East India Company) and therefore the suffering his people had to travel through under their colonization.

		FIGHT AGAINST BRITISH:
	</h1>
	<p>
		 The Rayalaseema region was transferred to British by the Nizam and Reddy refused pay taxes on to British . On 10 June 1846 he raided the treasury at Koilakuntla and marched towards Kambham, Andhra Pradesh (Prakasam District). On the way, at Rudravaram he killed the forest ranger. This being a significant matter, the then Collector Thomas Monroe issued orders to arrest him.</p><p>

Reddy, together with his army mounted a significant attack on British forces camped at Giddaluru on 23 July 1846 and defeated them. Unable to capture him, British deceptively imprisoned his family at Kadapa. Narasimha Reddy moved to Nallamalaforest to save lots of his family butthe British forces were tipped off by someone about the hideout of Mr. Reddy. To avoid being caught by British within the Nallamala area, Narasimha Reddy returned to Koilkuntla area and hid in Jagannatha Konda</span>

	<h1>
		DOWNFALL:
	</h1>
	<p>
		Unable to be at large for an extended period, Reddy was caught because the army moved in upon a tip-off and arrested him and his followers at mid night of 6 October 1846. The EIC put heavy fetters on him and paraded him right within the streets of Koilkuntlabefore his people with blood-stained clothes in order that it might be a warning to them. Around 112 of his followers were arrested and convicted for five to 14 years and a few of them were jailed in Andaman. The special commissioner of Kadapa conducted the trial and Narasimha Reddy was charged with revolt, murder and being a dacoit and was convicted on all charges. He was publicly hanged on 22nd February 1847, on the banks of nearby river within the presence of Collector Kokcrane. His head was kept on the fort wall up public view for 30 years from 1847 to 1877 to instill fear within the people in order that another rebellion won’t be tried by others against British .</p>

<p>
Another blot within the British India history. A patriot was dubbed as a murderer and robber and, at last, was mercilessly killed by the first British rulers.His revolt in India against British occupation was 10 years before India’s First War of Independence of 1857 also referred to as Indian Mutiny of 1857. The vestiges of the first events are well frozen within the ruins of the fort at Kotthakota, near Giddalur. Plans are afoot to erect a statue in honour of Reddy and therefore the government also has plans to incorporate his brave story within the textbook books.</p>
